# mail_plus

A new Flutter project.

The Project is mobile app similar to Gmail app.
This stores the user friend mail id as like we store contact no.s and when the mail id is clicked it open the view similar to the chat application. But the only difference is the msseage part would be look like mail format.
This uses AWS SES Services to send mail, using the backend as Laravel/PHP
When User write the mail that is subject and the message in compose page and send, the mail is to be send. 
It uses http plugin-in for getting connected to the laravel api.
